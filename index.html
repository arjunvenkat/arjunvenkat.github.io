          <h2>About me</h2>
          <p>I've been able to work in several interesting domains throughout my career, from teaching high school kids math, to teaching adult career-changers how to build apps, to consulting on software projects and most recently to building out <a href="https://www.digitaladventures.com" target="_blank">businesses</a>. Each of those domains on their own is quite compelling to me, although I do my most interesting work at the intersection of all of them. If you'd like to collaborate on something, please reach out.</p>
          <p>I've included a few of my favorite projects below. Feel free to look around.</p>

          <h3>Digital Adventures Product Revamp</h3>
          <p><em>Digital Adventures teaches kids how to make their ideas real with technology</em></p>
          <p>As the CTO and Head of Product at Digital Adventures, I lead everything related to the student and customer experience. My work here has included designing and building a learning management system to improve the classroom experience, managing our curriculum development processes, training instructors, developing our marketing website and building internal process automation. We've taught over 2,000 kids how to build with technology and we're excited to teach thousands more!</p>

          <h3>Starter League Teacher Fellowship</h3>
          <p><em>The Starter League was one of the first tech bootcamps in the country</em></p>
          <p>As the Director of Partnerships for The Starter League, one of my main projects was figuring ways to expand our reach to younger students beyond the full-time bootcamp that was The Starter League's Primary product. I built upon a teacher training program for Chicago Public Schools teachers that was created the year before and addressed concerns of the first teacher cohort including difficulties grasping the material and delivering in the classroom.</p>
          <p>The redesigned fellowship cut down the summer training time to three full-time weeks, which shorted the course length by over 60% but only cut out about 30% of the material. The resulting course focused on teaching the fundamentals of web app development through the same custom-made multimedia textbook that teachers would be using with their students during the school year. The flipped, video-supported nature of the lessons along with support throughout the school year allowed us to effectively reach far more students than the first year of the fellowship program.</p>

          <h3>High School Reach</h3>
          <p>Applying to high school in Chicago is like applying to college most other places. I worked with Principal Dassigner from Chavez Elementary to design a system that makes the process more transparent for students. This project let students enter their current test scores, grades and address to find out which selective Chicago high schools they were likely to get into. It motivated students to stay on track to get into their dream school.</p>
